Many are familiar with the board game Ticket To 
Ride\footnote{\href{https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/}{Ticket To 
 Ride} is copyrighted by Days of Wonder, Inc.}
where
players compete to build a railway empire, claiming routes between cities.
The game consists of a map of cities and various rail segments each connecting
two adjacent cities. 

A key way to score points towards winning the game is to complete
\textit{Destination Tickets}.  Each ticket specifies two distinct cities. A
player earns the points that are indicated on the ticket if they have claimed
one or more rail segments that form a path connecting the two cities.

There is one ticket for each distinct unordered pair of cities. In our
version of the game, each player is randomly given a ticket and they have
an equal probability of receiving any ticket. Given a list of rail segments
you have already claimed, determine the probability you earn points from the ticket you
are given.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains two integers $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^5$), which is
the number of cities, and $M$ ($0 \leq M \leq 10^6$), which is the number of rail
segments you have claimed.

The next $M$ lines describe your claimed rail segments. Each line contains two
distinct integers $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq N$) and $j$ ($1 \leq j \leq N$), which are
the cities that this rail segment connects.

\section*{Output}
Display the probability you earn points from the ticket you are given.

Your answer should have an absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.
