\problemname{Loot Chest}

Your favorite online game has a prize system. After each match you win,
there is a $P\%$ chance you will receive a prize. This value $P$ changes
over time:
\begin{itemize}
  \item every time you lose a match, $P$ increases by $\Delta_L$,
  \item every time you win a match but fail to receive a prize, $P$
  increases by $\Delta_W$, and
  \item every time you win a match and receive a prize, $P$ is set to $0$.
\end{itemize}
Whenever $P$ is increased, it is capped at $100$. That is, if $P$ is to be
increased by $\Delta$, $P$ increases to $\min(P+\Delta, 100)$.

The developers just revealed one of the prizes this season is a silverback
gorilla suit with star-shaped sunglasses. You want it! Each prize has a $G\%$
chance of being this gorilla suit.

You start with $P = 0\%$. You have an $L\%$ chance of losing each match you
play. Given $\Delta_L, \Delta_W, G,$ and $L$, compute the expected number of
matches you will have to play until you obtain the silverback gorilla suit.

For example, in the first sample case you win every match you play and are
guaranteed to receive a prize every $2$ matches. Each prize has a $50\%$ chance
of being the gorilla suit. So you expect to obtain the gorilla suit after
receiving $2$ prizes. Thus, in expectation, it takes $4$ matches to obtain the
gorilla suit.

% WE REMOVED THIS EXPLANATION OF THE 2ND SAMPLE TO STREAMLINE THE PRESENTATION
% In the second sample case, every pack is guaranteed to contain the
% prize you want so we just need to compute the expected number of turns
% until we open a pack. Whether you win or lose the first match, $P$ increases to $50\%$ after the first match.
% The probability you open the prize pack after your second match is
% exactly $37.5\%$ since you win this match with a $75\%$ probability
% and, if so, then receive a pack with $50\%$ probability as $P = 50\%$
% at the start of this match. If you do not open the pack after the second
% match, $P$ will increase to $100\%$ and you now have a $75\%$ of opening the pack after each match. That is, if you fail to receive the prize within $2$
% matches then the expected number of matches you must play from this point
% onward is $1/0.75$.
%
% Overall, the expected number of matches to receive the prize in the second sample case is then:
% \[ 0.375 \cdot 2 + (1-0.375) \cdot (2 + 1/0.75) \approx 2.8333333333333333333\]

% INITIAL EXPLANATION, REMOVED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLIFIED
% For example, consider the first sample input with $P = 0, \Delta_L = 1, \Delta_W = 100, G = 50$ and $L = 0$. In this case, you are so good that you never lose a match and every win will bring $P$ right up to $100$. Also, a prize pack has a $50\%$ chance of containing the gorilla suit. So,
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item When you are at $P = 0$, you will win the game but fail to get the prize pack since $P = 0$. But then $P$ will be increased to $100$.
%   \item When you are at $P = 100$, your next win is guaranteed to get you a prize pack. It has a $50\%$ chance of containg a gorilla suit. Then $P$ is reset to $0$.
% \end{itemize}
% That is, after every $2$ games you are guaranteed to open a prize pack which has a $50\%$ chance of containing the desired reward. In expectation, you open $2$ packs before getting this reward, much like it takes two tosses of an unbiased coin to flip ``heads'', so the expected number of matches you play is $4$.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single line containing four integers $\Delta_L$ ($1 \leq \Delta_L \leq 100$),
$\Delta_W$ ($1 \leq \Delta_W \leq 100$), $G$ ($1 \leq G \leq 100$), and $L$ ($0 \leq L \leq 99$),
which are described above.

\section*{Output}
Display the expected number of matches you will play before you obtain the gorilla suit.
Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
